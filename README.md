# README for Flow Sample Dataset Analysis for STAT 545a

## About this Repository

This repository contains an R project that explores the `flow_sample` dataset, focusing on understanding the relationship between water flow rates and various variables such as time (month and year) and station types. It aims to uncover seasonal trends, investigate missing values, and identify areas of interest for water conservation.

## How to Engage with this Repository

If you're familiar with STAT 545A, navigating this repository should be straightforward. To get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone <repository-url>` to download the project files onto your local machine.
2. **Install Required Packages**: The project heavily relies on the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages for data manipulation and visualization. Make sure you have them installed or run `install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))`.
3. **Run the Analysis**: Open the R script that contains the code for data analysis. Run the script from beginning to end to reproduce the visualizations and insights.
4. **Explore the Exercises**: The project is organized into exercises that tackle different aspects of the data. These range from plotting the distribution of numeric variables to investigating missing data and exploring seasonal trends.
5. **Check the Comments**: Code is commented for better understanding and annotations are provided in each exercise explaining the rationale and significance.
